{**OpenZoom Squared** is a fledgling experiment to enable the construction of large grid-based images from an existing body of files (possibly scraped from a remote website).  It then allows people to use deep zooming technology to peruse the grid and click on certain items to open new pages.}

{The source code has been published for an initial community review and just to get the ball rolling to see who might be interested:}

{A first test I made was for the [ImaginationSquared](http://imaginationsquared.com) art project, and an article/video was posted here on September 12, 2010:}

{Watch this space for more information as the project develops.  It was a learning exercise for me but I'd like to see it get some practical use.  In fact, it may ultimately become an alternate interface to thumbnail-based systems like [Albumist](http://hostilefork.com/albumist/)...}
