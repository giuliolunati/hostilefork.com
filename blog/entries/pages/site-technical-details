[update 1-Jan-2014 [

        {This is an article about historic technical details related to installing my site with Wordpress 2.5, which I installed in November 2007.  The "LAMP" stack was something I knew I probably would not enjoy dealing with.  Little did I know that the experience would be so annoying that WordPress would wind up leaving my occasional writings trapped <i>for over six years</i> in a system with a fixed-width theme that could barely display code samples worth a darn.}

        {Between then and when I actually learned something about web development, I made entire websites for other individuals, bands, projects.  Somehow the tedium of figuring out how to get the data out of an old WordPress just seemed like an exercise not worth bothering with.  Especially since I wasn't all that convinced other solutions were better.}

        {But for the 2013 holidays and my New Years resolution, I bit the bullet to get my data out and build a new site.  I'm sure WordPress has improved, but what I'm looking for in a publishing system needs to have more of a "programming" flavor.  <i>(I know many developers who have switched to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and GitHub pages, precisely because having developer-style control with reigned-in complexity outweighs large monolithic systems that seem to have every feature in them but the ones you actually want!)</i>}

        {So the following remains as a time capsule of the frustrations I had to work through just to get the basic WordPress installed, which left me convinced I needed something better...}

{I've had to do various customizations to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress">Wordpress</a> in order to make it a viable content management system.  Some of these relate to theming and plug ins, but there are also some outright bugs.  Here are the changes I made from the default installation, and hopefully they can be useful for anyone else who is going through the motions of dealing with WordPress quirks.  }

[heading "Visual Changes"]

{The theme I use is <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/kubrick/">Kubrick</a>, which is the default.  Here were the changes I made for visual customization, and I tried to keep it minimal.}

            {Another thing that's a good idea is to pick a background color for the header region that doesn't look too horrible while your header image is being downloaded.  Otherwise you'll see a flash of a color that doesn't fit your theme while the page is loading.  You make this change in two places in <span class="filepath">wp-content / themes / default / style.css</span>, replacing the hex value #73a0c5 in the header style with whatever color you think is most appropriate.  I don't know why this number appears more than once, but presumably they have their reasons:}

[heading "Manual Bugfixes"]

{The next set of problems I had to fix were related to bugs in WordPress, of which these all apply to the current version (2.3.1).  For whatever reason, they haven't been fixed in the default installation:}

            group

            {When you write a "page" (such as this one about Site Technical Details) Wordpress is theoretically able to handle people leaving comments and discussion, just like on blog posts.  Yet the default theme ignores the checkbox saying you want to allow comments on pages, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/115733">though some people seem to disagree that this is a bug</a>, I assure you that it is!  To work around this you have to edit your <span class="filepath">wp-content / themes / default / page.php</span>, and add the following line right before the end of the &lt;div&gt; whose id is "content":}

            [code php "<?php comments_template(); ?>"]

        ] [
            group

            {If you write "pages" in wordpress, the way you get them in an ordering is to give them a priority number.  Initially all pages get a priority ("Page Order") of 0, and in theory pages at the same priority level are sorted alphabetically.  For whatever reason, it doesn't work this way and Page Order gets completely ignored.  You need to modify <span class="filepath">wp-content / themes / default / sidebar.php</span> on line 46 so it says:}

            [code php {
<?php wp_list_pages('sort_column=menu_order&title_li=<h2>Pages</h2>' ); ?>
}]

            {Furthermore, if you have done any "widgets" settings in your wordpress it will completely override <span class="filepath">sidebar.php</span>, and thus won't even use the modification above!  So you have to click the options button for the "Pages" widget in that case and make sure it is sorting by page order.}

            {The XHTML that WordPress generates is invalid when you try to <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4287">put multiple categories of links on your sidebar</a>.  (By default you have just one category, "Blogroll", but I wanted to use more.)  The simple fix is to edit your <span class="filepath">wp-includes / widgets.php</span> file to have this line of code inside the function <code>wp_widget_links()</code>, right before the call to <code>wp_list_bookmarks()</code>:}

[heading "Plug-ins"]

{I had heard a lot about WordPress's plugin architecture.  After looking at it, I'm not so sure I'd call it an architecture, it's really just some haphazard hooks.  You find that there are ordering problems and cases where plug-ins do not work together because they both try to override the same hook, or are run in the wrong order.  Plug ins modify the source of Wordpress when they install in ways that are irreversible.  Despite this insanity, you can at least see what's going on... so I don't feel so bad about installing this set:}

            {The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache/">wp-cache</a> plug in.  This is generally considered a necessity.  Without it, each time Wordpress is asked for a page it will generate all the HTML using a long sequence of PHP scripts, hitting the mysql database many times.}

            {I had an unusual situation where wp-cache would not work at first, and it turned out to be due to the fact that I'd added the line:}

            [code php "define('WP_CACHE', true);"]

            {to the end of the <span class="filepath">wp-config.php</span>..after the line that said:}

            [code php "require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');"]

            {The instructions said to add the line manually to the file, but it didn't say <i>where</i>.  So I incorrectly assumed that the end of the file was as good a place as any.  Looking further showed that's not true, because there is code that wp-cache adds to <span class="filepath">wp-settings.php</span> that depends on the flag.  From reading the web I see a lot of cases where I suspect others are making the same mistake.}

            [note {If you're going to do any site configuration, such as of your styles or things like that... you'll be best to disable the cache plugin while you're doing so and then turn it back on when you're finished.  Otherwise a lot of your changes won't seem to have an effect, because the cache doesn't notice such modifications.  It only notices when you edit content through the site admin interface.}]

            {The very cool <a href="http://sw-guide.de/wordpress/plugins/link-indication/">Link Indication</a> plug in takes care of a lot of nice things... like automatically making external links open in new windows (rather than navigate people off the site where they forget to come back).  It also puts a lot of cute icons next to links, so you can see when they are zip files or go to wikipedia... a must-have!}

            {Installing this plug in is a little more complicated than most.  You have to install the plug-in and you also need to unpack the icons.zip file into a subdirectory of <span class="filepath">wp-content / themes / default /</span> (he suggests the <span class="filepath">images /</span> directory, but I made a separate directory called <span class="filepath">link-indicator /</span> to keep from polluting the images directory).  Also, you have to pick one of the numbered images for external links, his CSS mentions a nonexistent filename.  I just went with the first, so my <span class="filepath">wp-content / themes / default / style.css</span> says:}

[heading "Turn off the Visual Editing, Now!"]

{Finally, I will mention something I should have said up front--if you're savvy at all about HTML, <b>TURN OFF THE VISUAL EDITING</b>.  It will break your pages.  Even if you are in the code view and ignoring the Visual Editor, it will do bad things to your XHTML so long as it is turned on at all.  This is maddening, because one would think editing in the code view would encourage WP not to mess with it:}

        {Click the "Users" menu in the WP admin area to access your profile.}

        {Once you are on the "Users" page scroll to the bottom of the page, and uncheck the "Use the visual editor" option.}

    ]]

{After this is done, the only thing you have to worry about is that WordPress will still inject &lt;br&nbsp;/&gt; elements at every line break in the output.  So if you are entering delicate XHTML that would be confused by the appearance of a &lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;, don't hit enter in between lines inside that construct.}

{There are my tips so far.  I will try to keep this updated as I change technologies or make new findings.  I would like to thank my hosting provider: <a href="http://ericshalov.com">Eric Shalov</a>, for his server + administrative support.}
