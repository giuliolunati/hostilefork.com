{Merely plugging a removable drive into a mac (when it has write access) makes OS/X think it can take the liberty to write a lot of hidden garbage onto that disk.  If you want to stop this from happening, you have to put some special files on that disk *before you plug it in*.}

[list

    {To stop OS/X from doing Spotlight indexing, you need a file called **.metadata_never_index** in the root directory of the removable drive.}

    {To stop OS/X from making a .Trashes directory, you need to make your own file that *isn't* a directory and call it **.Trashes**}

    {To keep it from doing logging of filesystem events on the drive, you need to make a directory called **.fseventsd** and inside that folder put a single file named **no_log**}

]

{The contents of these files don't matter, so you can make them empty files using [touch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)).  Even better, you could make it a text file with a link to this post, so that you (or someone else) wandering across the files will know what they're for.}

{Apple's choice to do this is incredibly self-serving and shameful.  At bare minimum, hidden files and features like these should be off by default for any non-mac-only filesystem formats.  They should only be enabled when the user has been made aware of them.}

[update {One alternative to the method I described here from 2009 is to use a small GPL'd program for Mac called ["Eject for Windows"](http://www011.upp.so-net.ne.jp/decafish/EjectForWindows/EjectForWindowsE.html) ...which should probably be called "Eject *To* Windows".  It still lets the Mac put the files on the drive, but scrubs them off at eject time.  Thanks for the pointer, [Andr√©](http://blog.hostilefork.com/trashes-fseventsd-and-spotlight-v100/#comment-1216083726)!}]
