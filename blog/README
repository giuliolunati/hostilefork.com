This blog reboot uses the experimental "Draem" dialect of Rebol, which was
originally created to make it easy to document lucid dreams in a script-like
fashion.

The pattern used by Draem is similar to Jekyll and other static page generators.

This initial commit of pages comes from scraping a WordPress blog.  The scrape
yielded raw HTML which was semantically captured in Draem's dialect.  Extensions
are planned to make Draem less verbose, and to switch from assuming raw strings
as HTML to using MarkDown.

Hence instead of writing:

    [{Some paragraph.}]

    [{Some <b>other</b> paragraph, with a <a href="http://example.com">link</a>}]

    [H4ml3t: ("holding skull") {0x2B or not 0x2B... that's just 0xFF.}]

    [{<table><tr><td>Cell</td></tr></table>}]

    [{Another paragraph.}]

You could simply write:

    {Some paragraph.}

    {Some **other** paragraph, with a [link](http://example.com)}

    [H4ml3t: ("holding skull") {0x2B or not 0x2B... that's just 0xFF.}]

    [html {<table><tr><td>Cell</td></tr></table>}]

    {Another paragraph.}

So raw strings will be legal and use markdown, while html will have to be explicitly 
specified in a block.
