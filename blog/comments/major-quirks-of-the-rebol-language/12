[{You still have to shed a bit more of your old conceptions. <img src='http://hostilefork.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Standard libraries are usually not a good fit for a REBOL implementation. The Boost libraries and others are probably too big to be worth it, and the Boehm garbage collector was not designed for the fast-changing allocation of small amounts of memory that dynamic languages and REBOL in particular do. It's also difficult to port to various platforms.
There is no reason that the REBOL mezzanine functions couldn't be implemented independently just like the native C interpreter itself. As long as it isn't taking copyrighted REBOL Technologies code, there's nothing RT can do about that. The language at a conceptual level is a form of expression and not patentable. Actually, RT is releasing quite a bit of code under the BSD license or even as public domain, so it can be shared.
There have been a series of alternative REBOL implementations over the years, but ORCA is farthest along and the only usable one. The name does have to change someday, though.}]
