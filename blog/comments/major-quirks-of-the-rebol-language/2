[{"Iâ€™d argue REBOL is more defined by its runtime than its syntax. So whether you like the REBOL parser is only semi-relevant."
What you call the REBOL parser there is really REBOL's console behavior. If you aren't working in the console, the parser will be happy with FIRST on a line by itself. It's the way the console converts lines to blocks for evaluation that causes the problem.
Of course, it can bite you if you paste code into the console as well.
Nice REBOL articles so far!}]
